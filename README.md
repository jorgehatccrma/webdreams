WebDreams
=========

Pure web implementation of TweetDreams

This is a work-in-progress. See [TweetDreams][1] for more info.


Configuration
-------------

To run the server, you will need a consumer_key and consumer_secret provided by Twitter ([dev.twitter.com][2]). Once you have them, create a JSON file named `twitter_consumer.json` in the root folder (where this README is). Its contents should look like:

    {
      "consumer_key": "<your_key>",
      "consumer_secret": "<your_secret>"
    }
